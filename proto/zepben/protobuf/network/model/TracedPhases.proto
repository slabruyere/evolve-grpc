/**
 * Class that holds the traced phase statuses for the current and normal state of the network.
 * Each byte in an int is used to store all possible phases and directions for a core.
 * Each byte has 2 bits that represent the direction for a phase. If none of those bits are set the direction is equal to NONE.
 * Use the figures below as a reference.
 *
 * PhaseStatus:     |          integer          |
 *                  | byte | byte | byte | byte |
 *                  |Core 3|Core 2|Core 1|Core 0|
 *
 * Core:            |                 byte                  |
 *                  |  2bits  |  2bits  |  2bits  |  2bits  |
 * Phase:           |    N    |    C    |    B    |    A    |
 * Direction:       |OUT | IN |OUT | IN |OUT | IN |OUT | IN |
