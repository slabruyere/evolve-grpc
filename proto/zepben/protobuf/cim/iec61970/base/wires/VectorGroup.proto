/**
 * Vector group of the transformer for protective relaying, e.g., Dyn1. For unbalanced transformers, this may not be
 * simply determined from the constituent winding connections and phase angle dispacements.
 * <p>
 * The vectorGroup string consists of the following components in the order listed: high voltage winding connection,
 * mid voltage winding connection (for three winding transformers), phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11, low
 * voltage winding connection phase displacement clock number from 0 to 11.
 * <p>
 * The winding connections are D (delta), Y (wye), YN (wye with neutral), Z (zigzag), ZN (zigzag with neutral),
 * A (auto transformer). Upper case means the high voltage, lower case mid or low. The high voltage winding always has
 * clock postion 0 and is not included in the vector group string.
 * <p>
 * Some examples:
 *                YNy0 (two winding wye to wye with no phase displacement),
 *                YNd11 (two winding wye to delta with 330 degrees phase displacement),
 *                YNyn0d5 (three winding transformer wye with neutral high voltgage, wye with neutral mid
 *                         voltgage and no phase displacement, delta low voltage with 150 degrees displacement).
 * <p>
 * Phase displacement is defined as the angular difference between the phasors representing the voltages between the
 * neutral point (real or imaginary) and the corresponding terminals of two windings, a positive sequence voltage system
 * being applied to the high-voltage terminals, following each other in alphabetical sequence if they are lettered, or
 * in numerical sequence if they are numbered: the phasors are assumed to rotate in a counter-clockwise sense.
