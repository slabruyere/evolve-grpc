    // The following functions should be wrapped in calls to CreateNetwork and CompleteNetwork. The only requirement is
    // that any dependencies or associations that are referenced are created first.
    //
    // For example:
    //   1. if you have a PerLengthSequenceImpedance defined for your AcLineSegments, the sequence impedance must be
    //      created first.
    //   2. if you have an operational restriction that references a piece of equipment, you must create one of them
    //      first excluding the association, then create the other with the association.
